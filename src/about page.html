    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Our team has sought to provide our UMass campus with its own marketplace to buy and sell items from each other, through a website made just for them! Our goal is to create a means for a student to sell items for either a monetary transaction, as well as a bartering system in case there were other items they were willing to make a trade for. We wish to make the UMarket easy-to-use, fast, and efficient for your convenience!</p>
