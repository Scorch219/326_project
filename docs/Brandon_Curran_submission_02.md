The primary contribution I made to our project was building and organizing the team write-up. I attended all of our group meetings outside of class, and regularly kept up to date with my membersâ€™ work by asking if there was any point of difficulty they've been struggling with. I also built the YouTube account that Aristotel uploaded the video to. I regularly asked and confirmed that there was no member struggling with an unanticipatedly large workload I could share with them.

In the future, I do expect to maintain a more engaging role in the projects by taking on more challenging roles, either on my own or as a partner with other members.
