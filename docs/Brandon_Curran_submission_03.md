My role in this project was to prepare the team write-up, as well as implement a button which allows the user to upload a profile picture and pictures of the items they wish to sell. However, due to hardware issues I wasnâ€™t able to finish implementing it into the current submission. I plan to enter it for the final. I believe overall our team did a good job of communicating and dividing the workload in a way that made everyone involved and on the same page. I would say morale and communication has improved over time, but it was unfortunate that we required almost all the time given before the due date to submit.
