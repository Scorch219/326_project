I contributed by editing the init.py file for our project. This included determining the correct types of Faker data to inject into specific model fields, and populating
the models to reflect the relationships in our model designs. 

I attended all class times and most external meetings. I was repeatedly told my implemation of init.py was enough after asking for more work.

Lastly, I helped clarify meeting times and locations, reserving rooms when needed, and questioned certain parts of the modelds to make sure they were consistent.
