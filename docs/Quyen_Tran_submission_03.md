# Project 3 Individual Writeup

Due to the Thanksgiving break period and the general load of this assignment, there was not a lot of engagement necessary. Everyone, including myself, did discuss what had to be done and we did have to figure out what would be accomplished for future dates. Login functionality was very basic and I did sit alongside and keep up so I knew what was going on.

There was also the issue of adding in products to the database, which did run into some issues. Again, most of this was already resolved but I did try to have some say and figure out what could possibly be the issue with the errors we were facing. In the end, those 2 functionalities were working as intended and we continued on to discuss what needed to be done.
