# Innovative Idea

UMass Amhest students often struggle to find certain products they need or sell them near or throughout the semester. To remedy this, our project, UMarket, aims to provide a platform for students to buy, sell, or exchange products with each other, without needing to travel far distances to any sketchy locations that websites like Craigslist may demand. Listings will be cleaner and more organized, and users will find it easier to navigate for specific items.
