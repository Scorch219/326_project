Project 2 Individual Response: Ashley Tapulado

For the project I primarily worked on creating the base templates/page templates in order for our fake data to be displayed. I modified the user page, browser page, and product page with the appropriate syntax so that it would be able to display the correct information in the right places, as well as removing any syntax that wasn't necessary. Eventually other members in the group had also modified the pages based on whatever files they were working on.

It was very straightforward to do, so not much was done on my part, but I went to group meetings and helped with any troubleshooting that needed to be done.  I did not bring my laptop to these meetings as my work is primarily on my desktop, but could help point out any errors on other's computer's, such as Aristotle's or Tajour's. Since the bulk of work was already separated so much and much of the troubleshooting was done on Aristotle's and Tajour's laptops during group meetings, I felt like I could do more, and wanted to do more but I think that's hard to do with six people in a group if we set it up so we are tasked with something in particular.

Overall I kept up to date with the changes or fixes being made and witnessed the database info finally being displayed from the last group meetup. Hopefully as the project progresses I can add CSS styling and fix more bugs instead of being just set on one section of a project.
