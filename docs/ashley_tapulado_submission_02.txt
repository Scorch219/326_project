For the second project, I took care of the template layouts. It was very straight forward as all I had to do was to take the browser page, product page, and user page and modify the syntax to turn them into templates. I also created the base template that would be used for the mentioned pages. I also helped with any troubleshooting in group meetings in order to get the fake data to display.
