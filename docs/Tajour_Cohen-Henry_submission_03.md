# Tajour's Individual Write up. 

For project submission 3, I mostly played a supportive role in the tasks for this part. In the beginning I was providing info about the user login
and etc. so it can be implemented for the site. 

In the later half, I mostly worked on creating a product form to add in products in the site database. But that didnt go so well as I ran into some errors along the way. 

Overall the project was short but implementation was the bigger hurtle here this time around.
