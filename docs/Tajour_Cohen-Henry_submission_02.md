# Tajour Cohen-Henry Individual Write up

I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I created the data model set up on a site called draw.io. I made 
sure all the relations are correct and that the design is understandable and clean. 

I also coded the view.py to add functionallity to the urls and also edited the some of the templates and other files. For example, 
I coded some of the paths in urls.py, I added url support for detail views in the models.py, and django code in the templates. 

Also, I fixed the inital url problems that didn't work because certain additions needed to be added in the views.py and urls.py. And I 
also helped at certain points in the project to help with errors with the server, models, and site itself.
