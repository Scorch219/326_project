I contributed to Project three by creating and editing the page for adding a new produt, finshed by others as new_product.
This included modifiyng views.py, urls.py and user_page.py, while using django forms to populate the new page. 
I spent time correcting errors and understanding how to implement the forms.

I also implemented the category model in models.py and manually created categories intsead of faker data.

Lastly, I kept in contact with the team and was attentive to Slack.
