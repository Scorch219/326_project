## Quyen Tran Individual Writeup

I was able to make very impactful contributions to the success of this step of the project. Firstly, I helped in creating the models. This meant creating and designing the models for the User and Product features, and aiding in defining each oneâ€™s fields. 

Secondly, I helped in debugging the final steps of the product. Specifically, I was able to help in finding why for quite some time the data from our database was not being displayed on our web application. This included products not showing up on our browsing page, clicking on a product resulting in incorrect redirects, and user profiles not being loaded to a user page.

Lastly, I helped make important decisions in designing the product. This included decisions on how the model should look, features that should be included, and how products should be bound/related to each individual user. I helped with making decisions on what fields would be required for the user and for the product, and how exactly they should be used. Coordinating was also very important, making sure my work would be done in time for others to be able to continue working on their parts of the project.
