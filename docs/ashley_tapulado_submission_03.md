Project 3 Individual Response: Ashley Tapulado

I was unable to attend classes post-second-submission due to a complicated infection, but read up the slides that were posted in class. Upon returning, John, Aristotle, and Tajour had a grip on most of the authentication parts already. From there I observed what was being done and discussed to stay on track and figure out what will need to be ironed out and polished for the final submission.

There weren't any meetups as far as I saw, and work was mostly done on the days we had class. So when I was there I tried to set up the project on my laptop, but instead looked on with John as he was already working on the "add product" part of the project.

Looking at the current layout, I already know I'll be working on/contributing to the CSS and HTML for the final submission as well as assisting in working out any kinks of the app. Fixing the average seller rating, pictures of products, separating product/wishlist on the profile page, and stylizing the entire app is what looks like needs to be done.
