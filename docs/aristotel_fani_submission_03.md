Project 3 Individual Response

For the third project submission, due to the thanksgiving break, it seemed like me and my team scrambled last minute to complete the requirements for the assignment. In this submission, I took on the responsibility of adding in the login/logout functionality for authorized users. Specifically I added a new "subclassed" user to the model to inherit the functionality of Django's User class and just added some fields to it. I added the required files for the login/logout functionality and what the user can and cannot see if they are logged in or not. Still we have some work to do to clean up the website but I feel that we are getting close to the final product.

Also for the forms part, I revised some code that my teammate provided and got the form to render when you want to add in a new product. And with that when you finally submit the information for creating a new product, it successfully adds to the database and renders in the item listing showing the new product at the bottom.

I also was responsible for creating the video that goes through the website and shows how the model and files are used by the website.
